### Preparing for Week One

Each week, you will have exercises aimed at reinforcing the skills learned that week, as well activities to prepare you for the week upcoming. You should use your mentor time to review the exercises, as well as any issues you may have with the preparatory activities.

To prepare for Week One, you should:

1. Ensure Python is installed on your machine. Check out [How to Install Python](https://codingnomads.com/how-to-install-python) for step by step instructions, if you are unsure.
2. Ensure Visual Studio Code is installed on your machine. Check out [How to Get Started with Visual Studio Code](https://codingnomads.com/how-to-get-started-with-visual-studio-code) for step by step instructions.

If you have any issues with either of these steps, reach out to Ryan or Jon on Discord or via the email addresses below -- we're here to help!

## Capstone Project

Your final project should demonstrate what you've learned:

* A real-world Python app
* Uses an external API
